# üé® Java Design Patterns Collection

This repository demonstrates several classic design patterns in Java, each with a real-world-inspired example. Each pattern is implemented in a dedicated module with clear, extensible code and documentation for learning purposes.

## üìö Pattern Implementations

### 1. [Factory Method](src/creational/factory/Readme.md)
Implements the Factory Method pattern for document generation, showing how to create objects without specifying the exact class.

### 2. [Abstract Factory](src/creational/abstractfactory/Readme.md)
Implements the Abstract Factory pattern for a cross-platform GUI toolkit, allowing creation of families of related UI components for different operating systems and themes.

### 3. [Composite](src/structural/composite/Readme.md)
Implements the Composite pattern to model an organization structure, treating departments and employees uniformly in a tree hierarchy.

### 4. [Adapter](src/structural/adapter/Readme.md)
Implements the Adapter pattern to unify different logging systems under a single interface, allowing incompatible loggers to work together.

### 5. [Builder](src/creational/builder/Readme.md)
Implements the Builder pattern to construct complex `Computer` objects step by step, allowing flexible and readable configuration.

### 6. [Prototype](src/creational/prototype/Readme.md)
Implements the Prototype pattern to clone `Document` objects, enabling efficient duplication of complex instances.

## üèÅ Conclusion

Each module is a simple and extensible demonstration of its respective pattern, intended for learning purposes.  
See each pattern's folder for detailed documentation and code.
